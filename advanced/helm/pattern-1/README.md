# Helm Chart for deployment of WSO2 API Manager with WSO2 API Manager Analytics

## Contents

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide)

## Prerequisites

* In order to use WSO2 Helm resources, you need an active WSO2 subscription. If you do not possess an active WSO2
  subscription already, you can sign up for a WSO2 Free Trial Subscription from [here](https://wso2.com/free-trial-subscription)
  . Otherwise you can proceed with docker images which are created using GA releases.<br><br>

* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md)
(and Tiller) and [Kubernetes client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (compatible with v1.10) in order to run the 
steps provided in the following quick start guide.<br><br>

* An already setup [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/).<br><br>

* Install [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/). This can be easily done via
 
  ```
  helm install stable/nginx-ingress --name nginx-wso2apim-analytics --set rbac.create=true
  ```
  
* A pre-configured Network File System (NFS) to be used as the persistent volume for artifact sharing and persistence.
In the NFS server instance, create a Linux system user account named `wso2carbon` with user id `802` and a system group named `wso2` with group id `802`.
Add the `wso2carbon` user to the group `wso2`.

  ```
   groupadd --system -g 802 wso2
   useradd --system -g 802 -u 802 wso2carbon
  ```
  
## Quick Start Guide    

>In the context of this document, <br>
>* `KUBERNETES_HOME` will refer to a local copy of the [`wso2/kubernetes-apim`](https://github.com/wso2/kubernetes-apim/)
Git repository. <br>
>* `HELM_HOME` will refer to `<KUBERNETES_HOME>/advanced/helm/pattern-1`. <br>

##### 1. Clone Kubernetes Resources for WSO2 API Manager Git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/wso2/kubernetes-apim.git
```

##### 2. Setup a Network File System (NFS) to be used for persistent storage.

Create and export unique directories within the NFS server instance for each of the following Kubernetes Persistent Volume
resources defined in the `<HELM_HOME>/apim-with-analytics-conf/values.yaml` file:

* `sharedDeploymentLocationPath`
* `analyticsDataLocationPath`
* `analyticsLocationPath`

Grant ownership to `wso2carbon` user and `wso2` group, for each of the previously created directories.

  ```
  sudo chown -R wso2carbon:wso2 <directory_name>
  ```

Grant read-write-execute permissions to the `wso2carbon` user, for each of the previously created directories.

  ```
  chmod -R 700 <directory_name>
  ```

##### 3. Provide configurations.

a. The default product configurations are available at `<HELM_HOME>/apim-with-analytics/confs` folder. Change the
configurations as necessary.

b. Open the `<HELM_HOME>/apim-with-analytics/values.yaml` and provide the following values. If you do not have active 
WSO2 subscription do not change the parameters `username`, `password` and `email`.

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `username`                      | Your WSO2 username                                                                        |
| `password`                      | Your WSO2 password                                                                        |
| `email`                         | Docker email                                                                              |
| `namespace`                     | Kubernetes Namespace in which the resources are deployed                                  |
| `svcaccount`                    | Kubernetes Service Account in the `namespace` to which product instance pods are attached |
| `serverIp`                      | NFS Server IP                                                                             |
| `sharedDeploymentLocationPath`  | NFS shared deployment directory (`<APIM_HOME>/repository/deployment`) location for APIM   |


##### 4. Deploy product database(s) using MySQL in Kubernetes.

```
helm install --name wso2apim-with-analytics-rdbms-service -f <HELM_HOME>/mysql/values.yaml stable/mysql --namespace <NAMESPACE>
```

NAMESPACE should be same as in `step 3.b`.

For a serious deployment (e.g. production grade setup), it is recommended to connect product instances to a user owned and managed RDBMS instance.

##### 5. Deploy WSO2 API Manager with Analytics.

```
helm install --name <RELEASE_NAME> <HELM_HOME>/apim-with-analytics --namespace <NAMESPACE>
```

NAMESPACE should be same as in `step 3.b`.

##### 6. Access Management Console:

a. Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

  ```
  kubectl get ing
  ```

e.g.

```
NAME                                             HOSTS                       ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
wso2apim-with-analytics-apim-ingress             wso2apim,wso2apim-gateway   <EXTERNAL-IP>   80, 443   7m
```

b. Add the above host as an entry in /etc/hosts file as follows:

  ```
  <EXTERNAL-IP>	wso2apim
  <EXTERNAL-IP>	wso2apim-gateway
  ```

c. Try navigating to `https://wso2apim/carbon` from your favorite browser.
